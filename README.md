## UI/UX Design Planning

### üéØ Design Goals

- Provide a clean, intuitive interface for seamless navigation.
- Optimize for both desktop and mobile users.
- Ensure accessibility and consistency across all pages.
- Minimize user friction during booking, browsing, and checkout processes.

### ‚≠ê Key Features to Implement

- Search and filter accommodations by location, date, and price.
- Interactive map integration for listings.
- User authentication (sign up, log in, profile management).
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop views.
- Simple and secure booking flow.

### üóÇÔ∏è Primary Page Layouts

| Page Name               | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Property Listing View** | Displays multiple property cards with images, pricing, location, and ratings. Includes filtering and sorting options. |
| **Listing Detailed View** | Shows detailed information about a selected property: amenities, host info, reviews, and a booking button. |
| **Simple Checkout View** | Allows users to confirm booking dates, see price breakdown, and input payment information. |

### üß† Importance of a User-Friendly Design

A user-friendly design is essential in a booking system because it directly impacts user trust, engagement, and conversion. Users should be able to navigate listings, review property details, and complete bookings with minimal effort. A streamlined experience builds credibility, reduces bounce rates, and improves overall customer satisfaction.
# AirBnB Clone Project

## üìå Overview

This repository contains the codebase for the **AirBnB Clone Project**, a foundational project for ALX Software Engineering students. It aims to build a simplified version of the AirBnB platform, helping students gain hands-on experience with full-stack development concepts, collaborative coding, and deployment practices.

## üéØ Project Goals

- Understand and apply the fundamentals of object-oriented programming (OOP) using Python.
- Build a dynamic command interpreter to manage the backend.
- Develop a front-end web interface to simulate the AirBnB experience.
- Store and retrieve data using file storage and MySQL database.
- Learn how to use Git and GitHub for version control in a team setting.
- Follow best practices in testing, documentation, and code styling.

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python 3
- **Front-End:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for later stages)
- **Back-End Framework:** Flask
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Storage Engine:** FileStorage and DBStorage
- **Testing:** Python‚Äôs `unittest` module
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
- **Deployment:** (Will be added in advanced stages)

## üöÄ Getting Started

This project is structured in phases:
1. **Console Application** ‚Äì Command-line interpreter to manage objects
2. **Web Static** ‚Äì Basic static HTML/CSS front-end
3. **Web Framework** ‚Äì Dynamic front-end with Flask integration
4. **MySQL Storage** ‚Äì Data persistence using a relational database
5. **RESTful API** ‚Äì Backend APIs for front-end consumption
6. **Deployment** ‚Äì Hosting the app using a web server
